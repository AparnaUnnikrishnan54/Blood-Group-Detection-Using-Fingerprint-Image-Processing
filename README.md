# Blood-Group-Detection-Using-Fingerprint-Image-Processing
This project uses fingerprint images and a CNN-based deep learning model to detect blood groups (A, B, AB, O) non-invasively. It provides a rapid, cost-effective alternative to traditional blood tests, eliminating blood samples and lab equipment, making it useful for remote or resource-limitedÂ settings.
